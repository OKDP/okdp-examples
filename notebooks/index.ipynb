    "\n",
    "Welcome to the OKDP Sandbox Workspace!  \n",
    "This environment contains a collection of notebooks designed to help you **explore, test, and validate OKDP services** using practical and real-case scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data exploration and sampling strategies  \n",
    "- PySpark and Trino SQL queries\n",
    "- Python data workflows with Pandas and Altair  \n",
    "- Interactive analytics and visualization  \n",
    "- End-to-end demonstrations of OKDP capabilities  \n",
    "\n",
    "Among these resources, you will also find examples of complementary approaches to analyzing data with different engines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trino via Python + SQLAlchemy workflows**  \n",
    "- **Trino via SQL Magic (`%sql`, `%%sql`) workflows**  \n",
    "- **Apache Spark via PySpark workflows** \n",
    "    \n",
    "But the project is **not limited to these two approaches** — more notebooks, tests, and examples will appear as the workspace grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this hub as your starting point to navigate the notebook ecosystem and explore OKDP in a sandbox environment.\n",

    "- **Description:**\n",
    "- An identical notebook using [JupySQL](https://github.com/ploomber/jupysql) (`%sql`, `%%sql`) to run SQL queries directly against Trino, while still leveraging Pandas and Altair for analysis.\n",
