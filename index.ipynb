    "\n",
    "Welcome to the OKDP Sandbox Workspace!  \n",
    "This environment contains a collection of notebooks designed to help you **explore, test, and validate OKDP services** using practical and real-case scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data exploration and sampling strategies  \n",
    "- Trino SQL queries and performance checks  \n",
    "- Python data workflows with Pandas and Altair  \n",
    "- Interactive analytics and visualization  \n",
    "- End-to-end demonstrations of OKDP capabilities  \n",
    "\n",
    "Among these resources, you will also find examples of two complementary approaches to interacting with Trino:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python + SQLAlchemy workflows**  \n",
    "- **SQL Magic (`%sql`, `%%sql`) workflows**  \n",
    "\n",
    "But the project is **not limited to these two approaches** — more notebooks, tests, and examples will appear as the workspace grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this hub as your starting point to navigate the notebook ecosystem and explore OKDP in a sandbox environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following notebooks analyze the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset **using Trino as the compute engine**, focusing on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random sampling strategies executed directly on Trino  \n",
    "- Time-based feature engineering powered by Trino SQL functions  \n",
    "- Interactive Altair visualizations built on top of Trino query results  \n",
    "- Data quality checks performed over Trino-managed tables  \n",
    "- Explorations of distance, fare, and passenger behavior using Trino-backed datasets  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Using Python and SQLAlchemy\n",
    "- **Notebook:** `nyc_trip/raw_trino_python.ipynb`\n",
    "- **Description:** A full workflow using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Pandas to connect to Trino, query the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset, and build visualizations with Altair.\n",
    "- ➡️ **Open:** [NYC Taxi Analysis — Python Version](./notebooks/nyc_trip/raw_trino_python.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2. Using SQL\n",
    "- **Notebook:** `nyc_trip/raw_trino_sql.ipynb`\n",
    "- **Description:**\n",
    "- An identical notebook using [JupySQL](https://github.com/ploomber/jupysql) (`%sql`, `%%sql`) to run SQL queries directly against Trino, while still leveraging Pandas and Altair for analysis.\n",
